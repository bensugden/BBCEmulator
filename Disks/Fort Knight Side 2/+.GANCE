Don't stall on me now !", shouted Commander J.Gance, while punching every button on the flourescing console infront of him, in pure despiration. "Damn !" Gance cursed, as the auxihilery motors grinded to a halt, followed shortly by the electricity generator, cuasing the cabin to be engulfed in blackness.He fumbled around under the keyboard for the manual ignition lever, which he jerked violently to and fro in an attempt to restart the decaying engines.Finally, the rasping of the age-old turbines starting up, echoed round the cabin like sweet music. The pleasant whirring of the motors accelerated, to a high pitched squeak, and the Z-type slowly made its way across the starlit expance surrounding it.  Jedes Gance was a bounty hunter, he skipped from galaxy to galaxy in search of beings wanting other beings, dead or alive, but usually dead in Gance's case.They would pay huge sums of money for small tasks like annihialations of whole fleets, and the likes.He was one of the unknowns, he had potential, didn't they all, but he needed the big job, the one that'd make his name. He'd read about all the legends, like Fratarz who was once commisioned to capture a whole population, and kill no-one. And Kilid, the robot with a man's brain, who evaded capture from the entire Imperial forces, in the revolution on Gatrio in Kig five. Gance dreamed about the day he would be a legend, when even he will have a contract on him by other hunters.  The Z-types undercarriage swung down, and the craft slowly descended beneath the thick swirling clouds of sulpher, onto the sun baked mud of Thamos.The doors of the craft slid open, and Gance stepped down onto the planets dry surface.The green sky filtered the light, from the planets two suns, Jri and Fiw. The whole planet seemed to be dormant, there was no indication of life, save a few desert shrubs, peeping up between the cracks between the crazy-paving.  Then, as if from nowhere, a spectral figure appeared. It was a Thamon. It greeted him, and led Gance towards the City of Therimon, along the deserted road that apparently had seen no traffic since the dawn of the new constitution on Thamos, centuries before.  Thamons were of a state not presently known to man, they existed, their bodies could switch between a number of parallel plains, each with unfeasably different and inexplicable dimensions.Their images could be seen on the living plain, and on this they shared the same characteristics as solid objects, but their main existance is actually on one called by them the linear plain, where all movement, thought and light moves in one linear direction.They had many abilities, and almost infinite intelligence, telepathy, for instance was acquired by them very early in their evolution, which still eluded man.The Thamons were super-human, and their patience with man, and all sub-Thamonic people has to be admired.Only one life-form discovered has an intelligence larger than that of the Thamons, and that is that of the Quarts, however, little contact can be made with these 'beings', and this must be via the Thamons.  "Duration of repair will be 12 hours. Cost 12,000 Megacredits." said the Thamon in a death-like, synthesised voice.  "Thanks.", Gance tried to hide his awe is his tone, but to the Tharon, this was very transparent.  As they approached the blue city of Therimon, Gance noticed a streak of white light flit from one end of the sky to the other. The city was surrounded, on the east side by huge violet tinted mountains, the summits of which faded into insignificance.  Invisible from the crafts landing site, was a huge precipice encircling the city like a moat. Gance squinted as he looked down into the blackness, however, he could not definitely identify it as having a floor, it seemed to drop forever.'Surely that isn't possible' he told himself.  "It is possible. Infinite and almost infinite are the very same." said the Thamon answering Gance's question indirectly.  As he stood staring into the death-like pit, he could feel a definite tenseness in the biting heat swirling round his ears and in his hair.His hand slid down nervously by his side, and it slowled clapsed round the hand grip of his phator blaster.  When he finally looked upward, and towards the city, a long bridge, cutting across the moat, had appeared infront of him.The awesome powers of the Thamons cut deep within him, and made him feel distinctly uneasy.  The Thamon had already commenced his journey across the immence bridge,so, Gance cautiosly made his way across, treading with his heart quivering, he was only a mortal.The huge doors of the city swung open, and Gance gulped. Never before had he seen such and array of different beings in such a small area. Each alien in each multitude had a history, and a purpose, Gance stood for what seemed like hours simply staring at the huge stone walls surrounding the inner city, and the runic carvings engraved in them. He was almost illiterate, and as far as education went, he failed to graduate from 1 quad, and went to work as a maintenance employee in the empires shuttle 'Frari'.  As he gazed round, the officials docking area caught his eye. It was a modest entrance with ODA printed in broad letters above the small metal door. The city was absurdly backward, which was very unusual due to the Thamions great inteligence.Their brains had advanced, however, their technology had remained in a deep rut, probably due to its remoteness, and lack of building materials available on the planet, save stone, which was not of much use in machinery.  Gance pushed his way through the vast crouds to the ODA door, and his curiosity was so great now that he had to see beyond it.He slowly pushed it open, and peered round.What he was presented with shook him.
