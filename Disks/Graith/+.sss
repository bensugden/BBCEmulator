CEUS THE AMAZING WORLD OF HIFFIN UE The figures portrayed in this book actually exist, however, their characters have been edited for the more tasteful and diserning reader.( ie one with an IQ greater than that of a chicken ) The gentleman who first compiled a book of these strange creatures, living on another dimesion, was actually barmy. He was completely off his trotter. Irrelevant, of course, is the fact that beans do not resemble aircraft carriers used by the American navy and I expect,possibly foolishly, they never will. On with the story... Efraf Fraf Ef as he was known then to the tribe aptly called :Melon-brained-swans-which-live-so-far-away-that-I-recon-they'll-probably-never-make-contact-with-humans-as-they-have-melon-brains, soon got tired of shouting "HELP ! HELP ! I'VE GOT MY FOOT CAUGHT IN THE INCINERATOR !" and promptly removed his foot in perfect condition, as the incinerator wasn't on, and it was really only a figment of his imagination.(Which was avid, as he too was quite deranged.) Then, one day, he decided to try and brake out from his padded cell, in the asylum, and so came upon a terrific plan. This was no ordinary plan. No. This was a TERRIFIC plan. He decided that if he was to get out of the asylum, he could either: A Go sane, and walk out a free man. B Slice the wardens into stips, dice them,cook them, and eat one         warden a day. C Go SO insane that you will blow their minds, and he could walk out.So, he invented all the characters, which he could store in his cube shaped head ( Not quite accurate, more spherical really.)
