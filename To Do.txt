To Do:
----------------------------------------------

speed up inner loop
clean up emulator run control - move it out from win32.cpp and into bbc_emulator
rewrite ula stuff so it operates on ticks (there are more cycles than one frame right now!)
use registers properly for video ula
add cursor!
mode 3/6 support 
Teletext graphics fix
Look at keyboard stuff to make more robust ( track down why we lose keyboard control )
Arkanoid not running?
Knightlore not working
